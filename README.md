# All the Kids are Depressed – An Analytical View on Modern Music

Is it just me or is it that with every new song that drops these days makes you wanna break down in the middle of the day because of some unresolved trauma five years ago? It can’t only be me, right?

This repo contains the codes developed to pull song features using [Spotify's API](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.19.0/#) and scrape lyrics from [Billboard](http://billboardtop100of.com/).
An overall (aggregated) index for each song was modeled and calculated and plotted against lyrical sentiment and the valence of a song. The final chart can be found [here](https://github.com/Tango2503/modern_music_sadder/blob/main/commentary.pdf).
